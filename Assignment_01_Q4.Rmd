Observed Test Statistic for Permutation Tests:

Control: 
```{r echo=FALSE}
print(diff_in_means_C)
```

Biocontrol:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(diff_in_means_B)
```

Permutation Tests

P-value for Control:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
## PERMUTATION TESTS

#control 
combinations_C <- combn(12,6)
permtest_combn_C <- apply(combinations_C, 2, function(x)
  mean(calluna_C$Spread[x]) - mean(calluna_C$Spread[-x]))
p_val_C <- length(permtest_combn_C[abs(permtest_combn_C) >= diff_in_means_C]) / choose(12,6)
p_val_C
```

P-value for Biocontrol:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#biocontrol
combinations_B <- combn(12,6)
permtest_combn_B <- apply(combinations_B, 2, function(x)
  mean(calluna_B$Spread[x]) - mean(calluna_B$Spread[-x]))
p_val_B <- length(permtest_combn_B[abs(permtest_combn_B) >= abs(diff_in_means_B)]) / choose(12,6)
p_val_B
```

The above p-values show what you would expect from the results - that the control does not show a low p-value, i.e. the result we received was statistically likely to occur. Therefore we accept the null hypothesis that there is no difference in means between the controls. 
Conversely, the p-value for the biocontrol subset supports the hypothesis that there is a difference between the means between 2008 and 2012, showing the biocontrol treatment had a significant effect on the percentage of ground cover of heather. 


**Histograms**

Control:

```{r, echo=FALSE}


## HISTOGRAM

hist(permtest_combn_C,
  xlab='Differences Between Randomised Group Means',
  main='Permutation Test (Control)')
abline(v = diff_in_means_C, col = "red")


hist(permtest_combn_B,
     xlab='Differences Between Randomised Group Means',
     main='Permutation Test (Biocontrol)')
abline(v = diff_in_means_B, col = "red")
```


From the histograms I think it backs up the conclusions drawn from the p-values. The control histogram clearly shows the observed test statistic within the normal range of the expected observations, ie an expected result within the null hypothesis. 

The histogram for the biocontrol subset, however, shows the observed test statistic outside of the normal range of expected results showing that something has acted to disprove the null hypothesis (ie the biocontrol treatment).
